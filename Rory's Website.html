                <h2>We see the main character departs for the stars in search of awesome powers; after meeting two gods and obtaining such powers, he returns to Earth. Instead of loved or worshiped he was feared. With no one on Earth able to relate to or accept him, he went back to space, searching the infinite cosmos for the gods; the only beings left that would accept him. I chose this theme and concept because I think it's important for Gen Z –a generation where everyone's trying to be the best, the richest, the most attractive, most successful– to understand that what they seek may not provide them with all the happiness and approval they may think.

I hoped this would allow people to understand the chaos and overwhelmingness of all features in combination, while relating to certain features but not others. </h2>
